# Vim scripts for SystemVerilog

This is the agregation of different Verilog/SystemVerilog scripts found on `vim.org` and `github.com`.

The files are organized into `syntax`/`ftpdetect`/... directories so you can easily install them using a plugin manager (like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) or [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)).

The `ftplugin` script contains configuration for:

- [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)
- [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale/)
- [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar)
     * using [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)
- [and match-it](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39)

**Important**
Check each file for the authors/credits/licences.
